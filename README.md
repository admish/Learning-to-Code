* **IDE - (Integrated Development Environment)**: is software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI).
* **API - Application Programming Interface**: a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications.
* **Repo - (Repository)**: The project folder with all of your files, which includes a `.git` folder containing the revision history. (Should never edit the contents of `.git` unless you know what you are doing.)
