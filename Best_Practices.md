# Coding Best Practices

There is no standard on how code should be written as long as you are using a consistant style. Adopting the following things into your style will not only make it easier for other coders to understand your code, but future you may also need some hints.


* Write comments and documentation
* Use indents
* Use proper naming conventions
* Utilize libraries and API's to avoid "reinventing the wheel"
* Increase version numbers based on release: https://semver.org/

Using [versioning control](Version_Control.md) allows you to revert changes and save your code remotely. There are only a very small number of commands you will need when starting off, but it's also very powerful and multiple teams can work on the same project at once.
