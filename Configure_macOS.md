## Smart Quotes
Apple devices use “smart quotes” (or curly quotes) and “smart dashes” by default. They are generally considered easier for reading purposes, but for developers writing code, smart quotes can cause a few problems. There are two options to avoid encountering these problems. You can exclusively use text editors or IDE's that do not convert your quotes, or you can disable them system-wide.

### Disable Smart Quotes System-Wide
#### macOS
* Go to **System Preferences** > **Keyboard** > **Text**
* Then unchecking “*Use smart quotes and dashes*.”

#### iOS
* Go to **Settings** > **General** > **Keyboard**
* Then toggle off “*Smart Punctuation*.”
