**WEP**:  	Wired Equivalent Privacy; a security protocol for wireless local area networks defined in the 802.11b standard. WEP provides the same level of security as that of a wired LAN. 

**Whiteboarding**:  	"In agile software development, development teams use whiteboarding as a low-tech, manual way to track work progress. Charts and sketches are drawn by hand in order to work through a specific problem or task. Expect to do a lot of whiteboarding at bootcamp as it’s a great learning and development tool used in the coding industry. Whiteboarding is also used during developer  interviews for coding challenges!

**Wiki**:  	

**wild card**:  	A special character provided by an operating system or a particular program that is used to identify a group of files or directories with a similar characteristic. Useful if you want to perform the same operation simultaneously on more than one file. Example: the asterisk (*) that can be used in DOS to specify a groups of files such as *.txt. 

**window**:  	On a graphical user interface system, a rectangular area on a display screen. Windows are particularly useful on multitasking systems which allow you to perform a number of different tasks simultaneously. Each task has its own window which you can click on to make it the current process. Contrast to a "dialog box" which is used to respond to prompts for input from an application. 

**Windows**: 	A casual way of referring to the Microsoft Windows operating systems. 

**Windows**:  	

**WinZip**:  	

**wireless (networking)**:  	The ability to access the Internet without a physical network connection. Devices such as cell phones and PDAs that allow you to send and receive e-mail use a wireless Internet connection based on a protocol called WAP (Wireless Application Protocol). At this point, web sites that contain wireless Internet content are limited, but will multiply as the use of devices relying on WAP increases. 

**wizard**:  	A special utility within some applications that is designed to help you perform a particular task. Example: the wizard in Microsoft Word that can guide you through creating a new document. 

**WLAN**: 	WLAN is short for Wireless Local Area Network. Also know as WiFi, this is the linking of computers without wires. It is most commonly used for internet access, either in public hotspots or in private home and office networks. Connectivity is limited to between 10 and 200 meters depending on physical infrastructure.

**WLAN**:  	Wireless Local Area Network; the computers and devices that make up a wireless network. 

**WMI**: 	

**Wordpress**: 	

**Work breakdown structure**:  	A work breakdown structure (WBS), in project management and systems engineering, is an oriented dissection of a project into smaller deliverable components. It defines and groups a project's individual work elements in a way that helps organize and define the total work scope of the project.

**workstation**:  	A graphical user interface (GUI) computer with computing power somewhere between a personal computer and a minicomputer (although sometimes the distinction is rather fuzzy). Workstations are useful for development and for applications that require a moderate amount of computing power and relatively high quality graphics capabilities. 

**World Wide Web**:  	A hypertext-based system of servers on the Internet. Hypertext is data that contains one or more links to other data; a link can point to many different types of resources including text, graphics, sound, animated files, a network newsgroup, a telnet session, an FTP session, or another web server. You use a special program called a "browser" (e.g., Firefox or Internet Explorer) for viewing World Wide Web pages. Also referred to as "WWW" or "the web". 

**worm**:  	A program that makes copies of itself and can spread outside your operating system worms can damage computer data and security in much the same way as viruses. 

**Worm**:  	

**WPA**:  	Wi-Fi Protected Access; a standard designed to improve on the security features of WEP. 

**WWW**:  	An abbreviation for World Wide Web. 

**WYSIWYG**: 	What You See Is What You Get; a kind of word processor that does formatting so that printed output looks identical to what appears on your screen.

**WYSIWYG**:  	

**WYSIWYG**:  	

**X2**:  	A technology that enables data transmission speeds up to 56 Kbps using regular telephone service that is connected to switching stations by high-speed digital lines. This technology affects only transmissions coming into your computer, not to data you send out. In addition, your ISP must have a modem at the other end that supports X2. 

**Xcode**:  	"Xcode is an integrated development environment (IDE) that contains a suite of software development tools by Apple for macOS, iOS, WatchOS, and tvOS.

**XHTML**: 	Short for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language, XHTML is a hybrid of HTML and XML specifically designed for Net device displays.

**XHTML**:  	Extensible Hypertext Markup Language. A spinoff of the hypertext markup language (HTML) used for creating Web pages. It is based on the HTML 4.0 syntax, but has been modified to follow the guidelines of XML and is sometimes referred to as HTML 5.0. 

**XML**: 	Extensible Markup Language; A markup language for coding web documents that allows designers to create their own customized tags for structuring a page.

**XML**:  	

**XML**:  	XML or Extensible Markup Language defines a set of rules for encoding documents in human and machine-readable formats. XML is unlike HTML in that it allows for documents to display in a variety of additional formats outside of just a web browser.

**zero-day**:  	zero-day (or zero-hour or day zero) attack, threat or virus is a computer threat that tries to exploit computer application vulnerabilities that are unknown to others or the software developer, also called zero-day vulnerabilities. Zero-day exploits (actual software that uses a security hole to carry out an attack) are used or shared by attackers before the developer of the target software knows about the vulnerability.

**Zip drive**:  	A high capacity floppy disk drive from Iomega Corporation; the disks it uses are a little bit larger than a conventional diskette and are capable of holding 100 MB or 250 MB of data. 

**zip**:  	A common file compression format for PC or compatibles; the utility WinZip or Winrar is used for compressing and decompressing files. Zipped files usually end with a ".zip" file extension.
